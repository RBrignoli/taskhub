## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run both the client and server sides of the project.

### Client Side

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the `client` directory from your terminal or command prompt.
3. Install dependencies using npm by running `npm install`.
4. Run the application in development mode with hot module reloading by executing `npm run dev`. The app will be served at [http://localhost:xxxx]

### Server Side

1. Open a new terminal window (or tab) in your IDE/text editor.
2. Navigate to the root folder of this repository on your computer.
3. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
4. Run `npm install` in the root directory to install all required packages for the server side
5. Once everything is installed, start the server by running `nodemon server.js` in the terminal. This will automatically restart the server whenever any changes are made to the code.
